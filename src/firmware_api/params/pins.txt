#Pins are defined in Board GPIO mode.
#Input/Output is defined relative to the Pico.
#Ex. Pico_IN_Bit_0 is waiting for signals from the Jetson.
#The last character in a pin name needs to be the 
#identifier for the input or output pin, such as 0, 1 or 2.
#The gpio_api expects the LSB is bit 0 and MSB is highest bit.
